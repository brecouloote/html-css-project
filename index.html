          <p style="text-align:center;">Out of all the boroughs in New York State,
            the Bronx experienced the most death from the COVID-19 virus.
            <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-deaths.page">
              According to NYC Health,
            </a> more than 2,000 Bronx residents died from COVID. With the
            anticipation of a “second-wave” of the virus, it is important to
            know what steps to take if someone thinks they contracted COVID-19.

            Once you arrive to a testing site, the COVID-19 test is pretty quick.
            Although there are two different types of tests, the nasal swab test
            is the most common. A practitioner will swipe the swab along the sides
            of each nostril for 15 seconds. Depending on if you receive a rapid
            test, your test results will be known anywhere from an hour to three
            days. If you test positive, please isolate yourself for at least 14
            days and monitor your conditions. If symptoms become worst, seek
            emergency care. To learn more about testing, please <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html">
